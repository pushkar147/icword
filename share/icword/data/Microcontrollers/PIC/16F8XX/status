	D7	D6	D5	D4	D3	D2	D1	D0
	IRP_	RP1	RP0	TO_	PD_	Z	DC	C

1) IRP_ :
	This bit is used while using indirect addressing mode.	PIC 16F8XX has total 512 bytes of data memory divided into 4 banks. In indirect addressing mode, lower 8-bits of address are taken from file selection register (FSR) and the uppermost bit is copied from IRP_, to form complete 9-bit address.
	Thus,	IRP_ = 0	==>	bank 0 & bank 1 are selected.
		IRP_ = 1	==>	bank 2 & bank 3 are selected.

2) RP1, RP0 :
	These are bank selection bits for direct addressing mode. To address 512 bytes of memory, we require 9-bit address. Lower 7-bits are generally specified in instruction itself and uppermost 2 bits are copied from RP1 & RP0.
	Some SFRs are mirrored in all 4-banks. In these cases, the bank selection bits are don't care bits.

3) TO_ & PD_ :
	These are Reset status bits (Time-out bit & Power-down bit). These bits are used along with the SLEEP mode of PIC. After coming out of this mode, CPU can check these 2 bits to determine which kind of event is responsible to bring it out of SLEEP mode.

4) Z :
	This is zero flag and it is set when result of arithmetic or logical operation is zero. If result is nonzero, then this bit is cleared. Some instructions do not affect zero flag. e.g. decfsz.

5) DC :
	This bit (Digit Carry) indicates the carry from the lower 4- bits, during 8-bit addition. This is useful in binary coded decimal (BCD) addition/subtraction. During subtraction, if there is borrow from 3rd bit to 4th bit, then it is cleared, otherwise it is set.

6) C :
	This is carry flag and it holds carry generated by addition of two 8-bit operands. During subtraction, if the borrow occurs, this bit is cleared, and otherwise it is set.
